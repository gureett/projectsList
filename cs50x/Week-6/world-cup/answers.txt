Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: From simulations 10 to 100, it was expected that the time would increase however it had decreased by 0.001s, however this may just be an outlier

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would argue that after either 1 million or 1 billion simulations would be good enough as you would have simulated the games so many times that there would be minor changes if any after simulating any more.
